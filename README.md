# Prediction-of-Diabetes-using-Ensemble-Algorithms
Diabetes, a metabolic disorder caused by insufficient insulin due to pancreatic dysfunction, can result in severe health complications. Detecting it early is crucial. A comprehensive framework was developed for this purpose, involving outlier rejection, data completion, standardization, K-fold validation, and ML classifiers (k-NN, decision trees, random forest, AdaBoost, naive Bayes, XGBoost). To enhance accuracy, a weighted ensemble of these models was proposed, with weights determined by AUC performance. Grid search optimized hyperparameters. Experiments were conducted on a dataset of 768 female Pima Indian diabetes dataset(268 diabetic, 500 non-diabetic), using eight attributes.
